## 📝 Notes

- **Improvement #1** (Config Refactor) is the most critical but also the most complex
- Consider doing it in phases:
  1. Create new `SimulationConfig` class
  2. Migrate one module at a time
  3. Keep backward compatibility during transition
  4. Remove old pattern once all migrated

- **Improvement #4** (Large Files) can be done incrementally:
  - Start with `unified_visualizer.py` (biggest impact)
  - Then `simulation.py`
  - Test after each extraction

- **Improvement #5** (Test Coverage) is good to do alongside other work:
  - Add tests as you refactor
  - Write tests for new features
  - Gradually increase coverage
